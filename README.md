# HorizonXs (iOS)
#### API URL NOT INCLUDED.
Name of the project based on the radio station in the game Forza Horizon 4 : https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Horizon_XS 

App that allows the user to be able to select a car, choosing a unique combination of
manufacturer and model, and see a summary at the end.

## Requirements
- **Xcode 11**
- **iOS 13**
- [**Swiftlint**]( https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint "Swiftlint")
- [**Fastlane**](https://docs.fastlane.tools/ "Fastlane") (Optional) 
- [**Cocoapods**](https://cocoapods.org/ "Cocoapods") 

## Getting started
    git clone git@github.com:polar133/horizon_xs_cars.git
    cd horizon_xs_cars
    pod install
    open HorizonXS.xcworkspace

## Third party tools
### Swiftlint
It is a tool to enforce Swift style and conventions. Used my custom rules based on airbnb swift style guide: https://github.com/airbnb/swift

### Cocoapods
CocoaPods is an application level dependency manager for Swift, Objective-C and any other languages that run on the Objective-C runtime, that provides a standard format for managing external libraries.

External dependency:
- [OHHTTPStubs/Swift](https://github.com/AliSoftware/OHHTTPStubs "OHHTTPStubs/Swift"): OHHTTPStubs is a library designed to stub your network requests very easily

### Fastlane
Fastlane is an open source CD i.e. continous deployment tool that lets user to automate every aspect of the development and release workflow.


## Design Pattern

### Clean Swift (VIP)
The Clean Swift architecture is derived from the Clean Architecture proposed by Un- cle Bob. They share many common concepts such as the components, boundaries, and models. Iâ€™m going to implement the same create order use case in one of Uncle Bobâ€™s talks. While Uncle Bob demonstrates the Clean Architecture using Java in web applications, Iâ€™ll show you how to apply Clean Architecture using Swift in iOS projects.



## Testing
Both features (Manufacturers and Models) has unit tests. For coverage and information about the unit tests, there is a report folder generated by fastlane.
